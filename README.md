# LeetCode DSA Journey: Beyond the Comfort of Easy Answers

## Why This Repository?

This repository is not about copying solutions quickly.  
It is about **understanding**, **struggling**, and **growing** through the challenges of Data Structures and Algorithms.

If you come here in urgency for answers, remember: this is a guide to help you think, not just copy.  
True mastery comes from effort and learning, not shortcuts.

## Structure of the Journey

Data Structures and algorithms are grouped below according to what they fundamentally represent:

| Domain              | Description                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Arrays              | A collection of elements stored in order     |
| HashMaps            | Key-value pairs allowing fast data lookup    |
| Stacks & Queues     | Stacks: Last In, First Out; Queues: First In, First Out |
| Recursion           | Functions that call themselves to solve problems |
| Trees & Graphs      | Hierarchical and network-like data structures |
| Dynamic Programming | Technique that solves problems by storing and reusing results |
| Miscellaneous       | Problems that don’t fit into other categories |

Each folder contains problems representing the domain, with problem statements, solutions, and notes to guide your understanding.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Read** each problem's description carefully to truly understand it.  
- **Study** the solutions to learn methods and logic, not just to copy code.  
- **Reflect** on notes and explanations to grasp why the solution works.  
- **Avoid** copying blindly — practice and thinking lead to true growth.

## A Call to Code with Purpose

> “One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.”

This repository is for those who want to go beyond surface answers.  
Be bold. Be curious. Seek to understand the *why* and *how* behind each problem.

## Closing Thoughts

*Last updated: July 24, 2025*

May your coding be thorough,  
your learning steady,  
and your determination strong.

Happy coding and growth! 🚀
